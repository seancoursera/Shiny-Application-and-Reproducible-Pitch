## Simple shinyapp on predicting house price

- We will use the dataset from Kaggle on house price.

- You can refer to the following link: 

https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction 




## About the dataset

- This dataset contains house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015.
- Let's take look at the dataset:

```{r}
housedata <- read.csv('kc_house_data.csv')
names(housedata)

```

- We will take **sqft_living** and **sqft_above** to do the prediction. Refers to the living square feet and **sqft_above** = **sqft_living** - **sqft_basement**.

## Plot of the two regression line

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(price~sqft_living, housedata, col='steelblue')
abline(lm(price~sqft_living, housedata), col='red', lwd = 4)
plot(price~sqft_above, housedata, col='steelblue')
abline(lm(price~sqft_above, housedata), col='red', lwd = 4)

```

We can use either regression line to predict the price of the house.



## Shinyapp's UI

![](Untitled.png)

- Move the slider from 290 to 3000 to predict.
- The pink line is for **sqft_living** and the blue line is for **sqft_above**.
- We can also check the average predicted price at the bottom.
